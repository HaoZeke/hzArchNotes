# HaoZeke's ArchLinux Notes

## What?
A site to collect my random notes while I use ArchLinux.

## Why?
Well I wanted to keep track of how my configurations change over time. However,
my present sites are for more complete posts.

## Stack?
The software stack for this site includes:

- Gatsby (via the blog starter)
- ox-hugo
